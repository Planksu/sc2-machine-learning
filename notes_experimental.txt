- most likely lengthen tick duration, data amount huge atm so it would make more sens to perform slower iterations. also adds humanlike senses to bot
- add choices, still not sure how to reward bot though
- add multi output model, outputting weights for actions at that time?
- if multi output model, strengthen output predictions by using an exponent for the weights
